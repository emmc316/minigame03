# MINIGAME-03

A simple game that I made.
I used POO for this like my last C++ projects (a exception about Tres Rayas).
You must type an username and a letter which the program will use to print on 
the map as well like another objects called bonus where if you takes them your 
bonus will be increased by 100 each time that you take them.

If you take everything you win. It's simple.

There are still some issues like a bug in the score increased sometimes will be increased
twice or more times even if you are far from the bonus.
